# Dereferencing

Why do we need dereferencing?

Makes it possible to pass around values "by reference".
i.e. if you have

```
x = 1 and x = 2
```
We know to check 1 = 2. This is an optimization? Stops infinite loops sometimes,
because of narrowing?

Is this "nominal logic"? Noms here being the reference to "x"
